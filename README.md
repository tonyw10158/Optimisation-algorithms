# Optimisation-an-assemblage
------------------------------
A collective of selected algorithms from the book *Algorithms for Optimization* translated into the Python programming language. Currently, the repositories include some of the most potent algorithms from the textbook.

Currently, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing requires a continuous objective function(s). Example of such functions are found in the file of the same name.

## To-do
Add implementations for particle swarm optimisation, a discrete variant of the Genetic Algorithm, and a discrete variant of Simulated Annealing.
