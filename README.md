# Optimisation-an-assemblage
------------------------------
A collective of selected algorithms from the book *Algorithms for Optimization* translated into the Python programming language. Currently, the repositories include some of the most potent algorithms from the textbook.

## To-do
Add a implementation for particle swarm optimisation, a discrete variant of the Genetic algorithm, and a discrete variant of simulated annealing.
